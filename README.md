Bus Ride Simulator is the creation of Conner Clifton. Many thanks to Magentanova for sharing his starter kit, without which, I would never have been able to get this thing moving.


Above all, I hope you all have fun playing this game. I'm always open to any feedback or suggestions. If you see a grammatical or spelling error, you want to suggest a plot point, or you just want to say "hi", drop me a line at cliftonconner@gmail.com.
