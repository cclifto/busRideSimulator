Bus Ride Simulator is the creation of Conner Clifton. Many thanks to Magentanova for sharing his starter kit, without which, I would never have been able to get this thing moving.


Above all, I hope you all have fun playing this game. I'm always open to any feedback or suggestions. If you see a grammatical or spelling error, you want to suggest a plot point, or you just want to say "hi", drop me a line at cliftonconner@gmail.com.


******UPDATE*******
Jan. 31, 2018 -- Hey all, it's Conner. I don't know how many people actually track updates to BSR, but here's one for you. I'm currently working on expanding the content of BSR and adding a new feature. When I designed BSR2, I figured that was going to be the project I kept building; after all, I love RPGs. However, I found I wasn't having very much fun with it. So, I'm going to keep working on fleshing out and expanding the story and world of BSR. I will, instead, take features that I like about BSR2 and bring them into BSR. I don't know what you call that, but it's definitely in the vein of "a hard, gritty reboot". I'm nowhere near being ready to release the final version on Heroku, but for now, if you want to parse through my recent commits, then you can see some of the material that I've been adding.

Oh, and get this: It's all going to lead somewhere. I've spent a lot of time thinking about this story and I think you'll like where it ends up.

If you're the kind of Negative Nicky who thought my game was too limiting in dialogue options, get ready for up to FOUR WHOLE DIALOGUE OPTIONS. Move over, Fallout: New Vegas!

Are you a fan of implementation of Facebook's Flux pattern to create DYNAMIC DATA COMPONENTS that you can toggle as visible/invisible? Well, strap the heck in, buckaroos because those! Are! Coming!

As always, if you have any questions, ideas or general statements of adulation, you can always email me at cliftonconner@gmail.com.
